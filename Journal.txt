Wrote and tested a method to print the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal
3/6/25 - Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between different cave objects. Set up a new character class and test program.
Created 'Blorpington - The Wumpus Character' in the test program and tested the conversation method.
4/6/25 - Created the Enemy sub-class (of Character) and added its own methods for setting and getting the Enemy's weakness. Wrote a method for fight() that overrides the fight() method in the super-class. Updated the char_text code to test the new subclass objects (particularly the weakness and fight methods).
